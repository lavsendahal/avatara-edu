### About Course

Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence (AI) that provides the computers the ability to act without being explicitly programmed. Recently, there has been lot of progress in AI and the development is mostly due to the progress in machine learning. Today machine learning is used for self driving cars, object detection, speech recognition and computer aided diagnosis. In this course, you will learn about the machine learning theoretical aspects along with practical examples. You will get hands on experience by implementing a machine learning solution for different problems. There will also be a guest lecture from the researchers in top class universities and companies.

Machine Learning Course is specifically designed for the students of Nepal, Bangladesh, India and Pakistan. The course is designed by the experts in the field who were educated in these countries and also in USA, UK & Europe.
